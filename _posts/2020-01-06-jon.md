Following a prosperous early-life photography business, Jon found his passion in
life sooner than most: finding new ways to converge digital technology with the
physical world. Thanks to a fruitful football career, Jon attended
[Denison University](https://www.denison.edu){:target="_blank"} and graduated with
a Computer Science degree in 2017. Having worked on a number of high-profile and
comprehensive projects, Jon now works on a focused team of engineers building
[IKE Smart City](https://www.ikesmartcity.com){:target="_blank"}: a venture aimed
directly at bringing technology into the physical world to improve lives in cities.

_Jon currently resides in Columbus, OH._
