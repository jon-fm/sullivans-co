You might've seen Joel in his early years competing at Quarter Horse shows
across the West Coast. Soon after culminating his AQHA career with a few World
Championship titles, Joel kicked off his business career in similar fashion: with
a competitive spirit aiming for success. His determination and consistent efforts
to build a strong team are the hallmark of his works. Joel continues to mentor and
grow those around him while overseeing, operating, and managing at
[Target](https://target.com){:target="_blank"} in St. Paul.

_Joel now resides in Minneapolis, MN with his wife, Amanda._
